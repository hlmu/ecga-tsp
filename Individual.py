Exercise 2 Individual and Population Representation (10 marks)

Represent a possible solution to the TSP as a permutation of the given cities and implement it in a class Individual.
Evolutionary algorithms often start with solutions that are constructed uniformly at random.
Write a method that constructs such a solution in linear time â€“ not in O(n log n) or even O(n2), but in O(n),
where n is the number of cities.
